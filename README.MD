# paul discord bot
paul is a simple and fun discord bot written in python.

## what can paul do
paul is outfitted some very basic utility commands as well as some fun commands. paul is really just meant for my personal use, and as such commands will be added when I want them; this is not a professionally maintained bot and will not be updated extremely often.

## hosting
if you'd like to host paul yourself, it's pretty easy.
1. clone the repository into wherever you'd like to run him from. `git clone https://github.com/MattWyatt/paul-discord-bot.git`
2. install `requests` and `discord.py`. `python3 -m pip install requests discord.py`
3. rename `emptyconfig.json` to `config.json` and insert your information into the newly renamed file
4. run the bot! `python3 bot.py`
